
I am doing a project as a part of my job, and thus working with both personally sensitive and confidential data.
(Iâ€™m working on micro-level transaction data reported to the S-FSA under MiFIR).
Hence, I am unable to share the underlying data, but am able to share the graphs and code. 
As I am unable to share the data used in this study, I present the information contained in the datafiles used.
